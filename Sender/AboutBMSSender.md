## BMS Sender Classes

Two main classes are:

### BatteryChargingParametersGenerator:

This class is responsible for generating the random values for two battery charging parameters which are Temperature and State of Charge.

### BatteryChargingParametersStreamer: 

This class displays the two battery charging parameters (Temperature and State of Charge) in console continuously, with a delay of 2000 milliseconds, until the user presses escape (ESC) key from the keyboard.

## Sample of Console Output

Temperature : 21.9  State of Charge : 23.87

Temperature : 14.7  State of Charge : 74.13

Temperature : 40.6  State of Charge : 26.26

Temperature : 24.3  State of Charge : 61.45

Temperature : 16.4  State of Charge : 52.69

Temperature : 16.5  State of Charge : 73.62
